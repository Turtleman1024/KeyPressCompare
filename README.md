# KeyPress Compare Application

Simple algorthm that compares keypresses.

## Description

Write a algorithm that takes an array containing two strings where each string represents keypresses separated by commas. For this problem, a keypress can be either a printable character or a backspace (represented by -B). Your algorithm should determine if the two strings of keypresses are equivalent.

You can produce a printable string from such a string of keypresses by having backspaces erase one preceding character. Consider two trings of keypresses equivalent if they produce the same printable string.
